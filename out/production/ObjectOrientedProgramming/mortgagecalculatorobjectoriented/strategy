What do I need?
 - don't forget about SOLID Principles

 1 Class Mortgage
 State:
     - floats: principal, interestRate
     - byte years
     - constants: number of months in a year and percentage
 Behaviour:
     - Constructor + getters + setters
     - calculate mortgage
     - print mortgage
     - calculate balance
     - print payment schedule

 -> In order to respect the SOLID Principles I could implement an interface for printing
